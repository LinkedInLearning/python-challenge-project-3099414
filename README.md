Are you new to Python and looking for a bootcamp-style introduction? Or looking for extra practice coding in Python with project-based lessons? In this course, instructor Ryan Mitchell highlights what you need to know about the Python standard library, using a single project that you’ll build throughout the course. Each chapter focuses on a single Python topic—basic data types, control flow, functions, errors, and more—and provides a challenge and corresponding solution for each topic. If you’re somewhat new to Python, this course is designed to go hand-in-hand with the Python Essential Training course, so you can jump between both courses, or work in this course alone.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.
